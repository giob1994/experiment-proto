    <p>Welcome to the <strong>Price forecasting experiment</strong>!</p>
    <br>
    <p>You will be asked to forecast a price of a good in the future.</p>
    <p>On the screen, you will first be shown a graph of the recent past of weekly prices: hovering over the graph will schow you the value of each price in numbers.</p>
    <p>You will be able to add your own prediction for the next week from now: to do this, you will see a darker vertical line on the right side of the graph. Hovering your mouse next to it, you will be able to add a point (your price forecast) to the graph. If you want, you can drag the point to change your selection.</p>
